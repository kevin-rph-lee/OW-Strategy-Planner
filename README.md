### Adding Markers with Image and youtube video embedding

Markers can be added to the map to convey information like player placement, danger zones, and other game related elements. Each marker is held as a Google Maps geotag marker. 

Each geotag marker contains additional information provided by the plan creator within a Google Maps Infowindow.

The plan creator can also upload images which will appear within the info window.
